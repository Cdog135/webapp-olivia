Core Features
Multiple Room System
Personal Rooms allow each user to have a private space for individual decor, journaling, and creative self-expression. The Shared Living Room serves as a cozy common area where everyone can hang out, decorate together, and enjoy shared media. The Study Room offers a peaceful space for journaling, reading shared entries, and adding memory entries to the Bookshelf. The Gaming Room is dedicated to playing simple minigames with friends.
Room Customization
Users can collaboratively customize shared rooms and personalize their private rooms with furniture, decor, wallpaper, and themes.
Media Interaction
Shared screens in the Living Room enable users to watch movies, YouTube videos, and listen to music together in real-time.
Creative Canvas
An interactive drawing board in each room, especially the Study Room, allows users to doodle, create art, and add to a shared gallery.
Bookshelf for Keepsake Entries
A virtual Bookshelf in the Study Room lets users store and browse multimedia journal entries.
Bulletin Board for Quick Updates
A Bulletin Board in the Living Room is available for posting quick updates (photos, notes, or recordings) with reaction options like stickers, comments, and voice notes. Each post can feature icons for mood, weather, or location.
Mailbox with Notifications
Users can send multimedia messages privately or to the group, with notifications to keep them updated on new messages.
Minigames in the Gaming Room
A selection of simple, casual games like puzzles, memory games, or quick arcade-style challenges allows users to play alone or with friends.

Room Navigation enables users to move seamlessly between rooms, each offering unique features and interactive elements. The Message System provides notifications for new messages or updates in any room, enhancing the connected experience. Interactive Elements include the Bulletin Board and Bookshelf, accessible in their respective rooms for easy browsing and posting, along with clickable minigames in the Gaming Room featuring scoreboards and simple controls.
Aesthetics
Visual Style
The theme is cozy and slightly vintage to give a nostalgic feel across multiple rooms. Each room has a distinct theme: the Living Room is cozy, the Study Room is library-like, and the Gaming Room is lively. The Bulletin Board resembles a virtual corkboard with “snapshots” of posts.
Color Scheme
The palette features warm, soft colors with specific accent colors in each room: soft greens and browns in the Living Room, deep blue and dark wood tones in the Study Room, and playful colors in the Gaming Room.
Typography
Font styles are simple and rounded for a cozy feel, with handwritten fonts for personal entries to enhance readability across interactive elements and labels.
Layout
Screen Arrangement
The main area occupies most of the screen, providing easy access to interactive elements and decor options. The HUD (Heads-Up Display) includes a Notification Center with small icons showing updates for each room and a Navigation Bar with easy-access icons to switch between rooms.
Navigation
Clear start and end screens feature large, accessible buttons for a smooth user experience.
